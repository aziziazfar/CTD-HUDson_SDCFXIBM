# HUDson

## Existing Problems
1. Often times when someone realises that he is experiencing heat stroke, it is already too late.
2. Necessary on-the-ground information for the ROTA Commander to make informed decisions
3. Lag-time between accessing injuries and treating injuries

Thus our idea aims at tackling these issues by taking advantage of the availability of IOT sensors and IBM's Cloud Services.

The HUDson is an enhancement to the current bunker gear by integrating a wearable system within it. Sensors that measure the user's vitals such as Temperature (both Ambient and User), Heart Rate, SP02 allows for the commanders to keep track of the user's condition during training and operations. 

It also consists of a HUD (Heads Up Display) to provide real-time feeds from these sensors to the user. The system is also connected to the cellular network to provide direct communications between the responders.
